# Energy-Consumption-Analysis-and-Prediction

**Project Overview**

This project analyzes and predicts residential energy consumption in hot-humid climate zones served by eSC, focusing on July 2018 data. It integrates weather data, building characteristics, and appliance usage to understand energy demand patterns and support effective grid management.

**Features**

Data preprocessing including merging, cleaning, and transformation of multi-source datasets
Comprehensive exploratory analysis of energy consumption drivers such as temperature, insulation, and appliance efficiency
Implementation and comparison of multiple predictive models: Linear Regression, Light Gradient Boosting (LGB), and Support Vector Regression (SVR)
SVR model achieves highest accuracy with R-squared of 0.75 and lowest RMSE, providing robust energy consumption forecasts
Visualization tools to interpret model outputs and consumption trends across different geographic locations and building types
User-friendly Shiny app interface for interactive energy consumption prediction based on user inputs

**Installation and Usage**

Detailed instructions on setting up the environment, dependencies, and running the analysis and prediction models are included. The Shiny app can be launched for real-time prediction and visualization.

**Business Impact**

The insights generated assist eSC in managing increasing energy demand driven by climate change, reducing operational costs, and enhancing sustainability initiatives. Recommendations include adopting energy-efficient appliances, renewable energy sources, and targeted energy conservation programs.
